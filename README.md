# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This repository contains the work for the course project for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" Coursera course.

## Project Goal

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.

## Files in this Repository

*   **`run_analysis.R`**: The main R script that performs all the data cleaning and transformation steps.
*   **`FinalTidyData.txt`**: The final, tidy data set generated by the R script. This is the output from Step 5 of the project instructions.
*   **`CodeBook.md`**: The code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.
*   **`README.md`**: This file, which explains the project and how to use the files in this repository.

## How to Run the Analysis

1.  **Download the data:** The `run_analysis.R` script will automatically download and unzip the source data from:  
    [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

2.  **Run the script:**
    *   Place the `run_analysis.R` script in your R working directory.
    *   Source the script in R: `source("run_analysis.R")`.
    *   The script requires the `dplyr` package, and will automatically install it if it is not found.

3.  **Output:**
    *   The script will generate a file named `FinalTidyData.txt` in your working directory. This file contains the tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Data Transformation Steps

The `run_analysis.R` script performs the following steps to clean the data:

1.  **Merges the training and the test sets:** Reads the training and test data sets and combines them into a single data frame.
2.  **Extracts mean and standard deviation:** Subsets the merged data to include only the columns that contain mean or standard deviation measurements, in addition to the subject and activity identifiers.
3.  **Uses descriptive activity names:** Replaces the numeric activity codes (1-6) with their descriptive names (e.g., "WALKING", "SITTING").
4.  **Appropriately labels the variables:** Cleans up the column names to be more descriptive and human-readable by removing special characters and using full-word descriptions (e.g., "Time" instead of "t", "Accelerometer" instead of "Acc").
5.  **Creates a final tidy data set:** From the cleaned data, it creates a second, independent tidy data set containing the average of each variable for each unique combination of subject and activity.
